# About
This script will ping certain IP Address (google.com by default) and if there is no reply it will send notification


Wrote this code because my internet kept disconnecting and reconnecting because of ISP DNS issues
and it's really annoying when you're playing game and have to check if it really disconnected and if it connected back

# Todos

- running it in background with icon to show the status with close button option
- differentiate packet loss from actual disconnect

probably won't add those cause i resolved my internet issue
